# SMT-Code-HW-HD
Accompanying source codes for the paper **A New Approach For Side Channel Analysis On Stream Ciphers And Related Constructions** (accepted in [IEEE-TC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9650579))


Side channel attack of the three ciphers are considered; Lizard, Plantlet and Grain-128-AEAD. The Hamming weight leakage (from software) and the Hamming distance leakage (from hardware) are modelled through SMT. The formulated SMT instances are solved with the Z3 SMT solver. In this way, attacks during the initialisation as well as the pseudo-random generation phases are feasible.
